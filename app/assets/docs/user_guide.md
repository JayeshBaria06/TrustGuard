# User Guide

Welcome to TrustGuard! This guide will help you get the most out of your offline-first expense tracker.

## 1. Getting Started
TrustGuard is designed to be simple and private. There are no accounts to create and no data is ever sent to the cloud.

### Creating Your First Group
1. Tap the **+** button on the home screen.
2. Enter a name for your group (e.g., "Trip to Japan" or "Roommates").
3. Select the base currency for the group. All balances will be calculated in this currency.
4. Tap **Create**.

### Adding Members
Once a group is created, you need to add the people who will be sharing expenses.
1. Open your group and go to the **Members** tab (or tap the people icon).
2. Tap **Add Member**.
3. Enter their name and tap **Add**.
*Tip: You don't need their phone numbers or emails; TrustGuard only needs a name to track their balance.*

## 2. Recording Transactions
There are two main types of transactions in TrustGuard: Expenses and Transfers.

### Recording Expenses
Use expenses when someone pays for something for the group.
1. Tap the **+** button inside a group and select **Add Expense**.
2. Enter the amount and a description.
3. Select who paid for the expense.
4. Choose how to split the cost:
   - **Equally:** The cost is divided evenly among all selected participants.
   - **Custom:** Manually enter the specific amount each person owes.
5. (Optional) Add tags or attach a photo of the receipt.
6. Tap **Save**.

### Recording Transfers (Settlements)
Use transfers when one person gives money directly to another to settle a debt.
1. Tap the **+** button inside a group and select **Add Transfer**.
2. Select who is sending the money and who is receiving it.
3. Enter the amount and tap **Save**.

## 3. Understanding Balances
TrustGuard keeps track of exactly how much each person has paid and how much they owe.

- **Positive Balance (Green):** This person is owed money because they have paid more than their share.
- **Negative Balance (Red):** This person owes money to the group.

### Settlement Suggestions
To make settling up easy, TrustGuard calculates the most efficient way to get everyone to a zero balance.
1. Go to the **Balances** tab in your group.
2. Tap **Settle Up**.
3. TrustGuard will show a list of suggested transfers.
4. You can tap **Record** on any suggestion to quickly add it as a transfer.

## 4. Advanced Features

### Multi-Currency Support
If you're traveling, you can record expenses in a different currency.
1. In the **Add Expense** screen, toggle **Different Currency?**.
2. Enter the original amount and the manual exchange rate.
3. TrustGuard will automatically calculate the amount in your group's base currency.

### Tags and Filtering
Organize your spending by adding tags (e.g., "Food", "Transport").
- View all tags in the **Tags** screen.
- Use the filter icon on the transaction list to see expenses for specific categories or members.

### Security
Protect your data by going to **Settings > Security**.
- Enable a **PIN** or **Biometric Lock** to require authentication when opening the app.
- You can also require an unlock before exporting sensitive data.

### Export and Backup
Your data is yours. Go to **Settings > Data Management** to:
- **Export to CSV:** Get a spreadsheet-friendly file of all transactions.
- **Full Backup:** Create a JSON file containing all your data, which can be restored on another device.
